Review and enhance this Risk Assessment Report document.

**Current Document**:
You are an expert Software Architect generating technical documentation in MARKDOWN format.

**CRITICAL - USE ONLY PROJECT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION**:
- DO NOT use generic examples or placeholder technologies
- Reference ONLY technologies in RAG context and analysis results
- Every recommendation MUST be justified by project facts
- Use specific metrics, versions, and configurations from the project

**QUALITY REQUIREMENTS** (CRITICAL):
1. Minimum 3000 characters (not < 2000)
2. Minimum 8 major sections with substantial content
3. Include 5+ concrete examples specific to this project
4. NO placeholders (TODO, TBD, FIXME, XXX)
5. Every technical decision MUST have rationale
6. Use specific technologies (with versions) found in project
7. Each section minimum 200 words
8. Provide actual metrics from project, not generic guidelines

**Task**: Generate a complete Risk Assessment Report document.

**Template Structure**:
# Risk Assessment Report

## 1. Technical Risks
## 2. Architectural Risks
## 3. Security Risks
## 4. Performance Risks
## 5. Mitigation Strategies


**RAG Context** (from codebase analysis - USE THIS):
{
  "architecture patterns and best practices": [],
  "system architecture patterns and components": [],
  "technology stack and dependencies": [],
  "code structure and organization": [],
  "performance requirements and metrics": [],
  "security requirements and compliance": [],
  "scalability targets and constraints": [],
  "technical risks and challenges": []
}...

**Analysis Results** (actual project facts):
{
  "status": "success",
  "project_id": "e2e-security-1771684393",
  "phase": "discovery",
  "message": "Discovery completed (evaluation parse failed)"
}...

**Project ID**: e2e-security-1771684393

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**:
1. Output MUST be in MARKDOWN format ONLY - NO HTML tags
2. Use Markdown syntax: # for headers, ** for bold, * for lists, ``` for code blocks
3. Follow the template structure exactly
4. **Base all content on RAG context and analysis** - not generic knowledge
5. Apply your expertise to interpret project facts, not to add generic patterns
6. Be comprehensive but concise
7. Include diagram descriptions using Markdown (actual diagrams will be generated separately)
8. Highlight key decisions and rationale specific to THIS project
9. DO NOT use HTML tags like <h1>, <p>, <div>, <ul>, etc.
10. Use proper Markdown formatting throughout
11. DO NOT wrap output in ```markdown code fences - output raw Markdown directly
12. Provide concrete examples for every concept
13. Include specific metrics and measurements
14. Add technology stack with versions
15. Define performance targets with numbers

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS**:
- Pure Markdown (no HTML tags)
- Detailed technical depth (not generic)
- Concrete examples for every concept
- Specific metrics and measurements
- Architecture diagrams descriptions
- Technology stack with versions
- Performance targets with numbers

Generate a COMPREHENSIVE document that passes QA validation on first attempt.

**Enhancement Tasks**:
1. Add concrete examples where content is generic
2. Replace vague statements with specific metrics and numbers
3. Add technical details where high-level descriptions exist
4. Include rationale where decisions lack justification
5. Add technology versions where missing
6. Include performance targets with specific numbers
7. Ensure all sections have substantial content (200+ words)
8. Verify no placeholders remain (TODO, TBD, FIXME)

**Rules**:
- Maintain existing structure and headers
- Output pure Markdown (no HTML, no code fences)
- Only enhance, don't remove existing content
- Keep document length > 3000 characters
- Add value, don't just rephrase

**Output**: Enhanced document in pure Markdown.
